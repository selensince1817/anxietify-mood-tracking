A little clarification

Each track in Spotify has various parameters determined by holy algorithms.
Simply saying, each time an artist uploads a track to Spotify, a Machine Learning is used to try and quantify the track to enable better recommendation system as well as those cool features like Spotify Wrapped, etc.
Those parameters can include:

How danceable the track is.

How melodic the track is.

The happiness level of the track.

And so on...

Please feel free to review the repo and request an access to the app (due to limitations of Spotify API, I can not grant a public access to everyone).
